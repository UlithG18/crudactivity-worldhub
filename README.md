# Varkun - Realm of the Blood-Forges

**Team Name:** Volcanic Forgers 

**Group Members:** Julián Aponte, Andreina Arevale, Faiber Camacho, Ulith Giraldo  

**Year:** 2025

## Description
Varkun is the homeland of the orcs: a vast volcanic territory shaped by blood forges, ritual combat, and iron craftsmanship. This project represents the world through a static webpage built using semantic HTML and structured CSS, following the requirements of the Crudzaso Atlas.

The site contains characters, places, weapons, and visual elements inspired by the dark–fantasy culture of the Orc race.

## Semantics Used
We used a wide set of HTML5 semantic tags to ensure correct structure, accessibility, and clean organization:
```
- <header>
- <nav>
- <main> 
- <section>
- <article>
- <figure>
- <img>
- <footer>
- <audio>
- <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <strong>
- <a>
```

## Git & branches
We organized our work using a feature-branch workflow:
- Each member created a branch for their assigned feature
- After completing their section, they submitted commits with clear messages
- Branches were merged into main

We worked with these feature branches:
- feature/atlas-cards  
- feature/structural-main  
- feature/footer  

## Andreina

I created the HTML visual layout containing the cards for characters, places, and weapons of the Orc race. I structured the content using semantic tags such as section, article, and figure, and organized the cards into groups of three. 
I worked with the cardss.html file and linked it to the corresponding CSS stylesheet. 
In cardss.css, I designed the card layouts, the Row container, the circular images, and all related styling, including background, spacing, and responsive behavior using media queries. I also managed the images included in this section of the project.

## Faiber

I built the initial base structure of the HTML document using the required semantic tags. I developed the entire “Relations” section and its corresponding CSS styles.
The semantic elements I worked with include head, nav, main, section, and footer. My responsibility was to ensure that each part of the page was semantically correct, functional, and clearly separated for readability and teamwork.

## Ulith

I handled the project documentation and created the footer layout. Later, I took responsibility for the GitHub repository, including the setup, branch organization, merges, and correction of structural issues. Because of this, I also supported the team with file organization and general troubleshooting across the project.

## Julián

I created the homepage structure in HTML and worked on the visual layout of the landing page. I designed the titles, introductory sections, and contributed to the footer’s final layout and visual polish.
