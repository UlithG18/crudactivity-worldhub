                In this project, the goal was to create an HTML visual layout featuring cards that represent the
                characters, places, and weapons used by the Orc race. These cards are divided into blocks of three and
                were built using semantic tags such as section, article, and figure.

                The design includes a fixed background, custom fonts, fantasy-style cards, and circular images.

                For the structure of the page, we used an HTML file (cardss.html) that contains all the written content
                and layout organization. In this file, we linked the CSS stylesheet and arranged the cards within
                sections and articles—sections represented each category, while articles contained each individual card.

                We also used a CSS file (cardss.css) to create all visual adjustments, including sizes, shapes, card
                styles, text fonts, and more. In this file, we defined the container (Row) that organizes the cards into
                three columns. The goal was not only to split the layout into thirds but also to add spacing between
                cards, adapt to available space, and correctly center each card.

                Additionally, responsive design was implemented using @media, ensuring that the page displays correctly
                on mobile devices.

                We added the .card class, where all card modifications were made, such as background, size, and other
                visual properties.
                We also used .card figure img, which handled the styling of the images placed inside the cards.

                The website background was configured within the CSS file as well.

                The project folder contains all the images used in this section of the page.<br><br>

                I created the entire base structure for the HTML project using the required semantic tags, as well as
                the “Relations” section and its CSS styling.

                The semantic elements I used include:

                head: Header of the page

                nav: Contains the navigation menu so users can quickly move between sections

                main: Main content of the page

                section: Independent blocks for each part of the page

                footer: Bottom area where additional information is added<br><br>

                I was responsible for the documentation and the footer. However, I later took charge of the repository
                and everything related to GitHub. Because of this, I ended up helping resolve issues that came up and
                contributing to the overall organization of the project files<br><br>
